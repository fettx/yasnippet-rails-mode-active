# yasnippet-rails-mode-active

These are the settings that I have for ruby-mode, when I run yasnippet and I find it easier to write code ...
for example: ln + TAB , to display <% = link_to 'something', something_path %>
== + TAB , and to display <%= | %>
instead of writing all <% end%> enough just to end more TAB and appears <% end%>

and also with the various ... Fillers
